# RNA-sequencing-extraction-of-listed-names
# The code included here within was developed using my very rudimentary coding ability and google.
# It was designed with the aim of taking RNA sequencing results from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases and extracting genes associated with a list
# Included here are my various codes for converting the different file types in to parisble files and then subsequent extraction of the specified genes and reads associated
